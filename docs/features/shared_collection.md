# Shared Collections

Shared collections are curated document sets provided to all users. When enabled, they act as additional context sources for RAG answers.

## Enable collections
1. Open the **Knowledge Base** menu in the left sidebar.
2. Select **Shared collections** to open the sidebar.
3. Toggle the switch next to each collection you want to include; selections are saved locally in your browser.

## How it works
- Enabled collections are considered during retrieval when you send a prompt.
- Descriptions in the list explain the scope of each collection to help you choose the right ones.
